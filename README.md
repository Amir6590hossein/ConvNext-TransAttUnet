# Enhanced TransAttUnet Architecture

This repository contains the source code for an improved deep learning architecture designed for medical image segmentation. Our work builds upon and enhances the TransAttUnet framework, introducing architectural modifications to optimize segmentation performance.

## Reference Paper

This project is based on the research presented in the following publication:

**Title:** TransAttUnet: Multi-Level Attention-Guided U-Net With Transformer for Medical Image Segmentation
**DOI:** 10.1109/TETCI.2023.3309626
**URL:** https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10244199

## Repository Contents

Please note that this repository currently hosts the **model architecture code only**. It serves as a reference for the specific structural improvements proposed in our study.

## Access to Full Implementation

For researchers and developers interested in the complete codebase—including data preprocessing scripts, the full training pipeline, validation loops, and solver configurations—please contact the authors directly to request access:
